#My name is Luis Felipe
# I am from Mexico City
# I am currently studying at Tec de Monterrey while simoultaneously working in the development of two startups and taking the Ironhack bootcamp
# Unfortunately I have no previous experience with anything to do with programming or data analysis
# But I am here to learn about all that stuff because I believe it is very important to know these things due to the modern technologic era in which we live in
# My psychologist recommended me this course because a few of his patients took it in the past, then I saw the learning program and was inmediately attracted to the course
# I expect to end this course with programming and data analysis skills, also with tools that involve self learning and learning by doing
# After this bootcamp I expect to get a job involving all the stuff I learned throughout the course, I would like it to be something related with sports
# I would love to go into the sports industry but i dont mind getting into financial or other industries
# I would like to implement everything i learn here and mix this knowledge with my leadership skills in order to be a leader technology-oriented
# My career goal is to have my own company
