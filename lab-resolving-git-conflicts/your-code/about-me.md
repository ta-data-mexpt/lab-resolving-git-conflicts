I am Cosme Urdaibay

I live in Mexico City and I am above everything else a curious person. Also a self taught programmer ready to take the next step at Ironhack’s Data Analytics Bootcamp.

Can’t forget to mention I’m a clinical psychologist who has spent a lot of time working in education and special education.

Along the way of my psychology career, while I was completely focused on understanding why people are weird?! I forgot other passions and interests like figuring out how everything else works. So while psychology took me to psychoanalysis who directed me to sociology, I worked my practice that made me get in touch, amongst other things, with a bunch of schools and NGO’s focused on education. That’s always a ton of paperwork.

Constantly I found myself more interested in the process of automating my workflow or gathering and structuring data so I could figure stuff out, than the actual task. At the time I thought it was a fun way to swallow a bitter pill.

It came the day that one of my side work projects got me in contact with python through a data scientist friend of mine: What a joyful moment when I finished my first project! I had all the data I needed to work, in a single file, without copying tons of .pdf by hand. By the time I finished I had fallen in love with my command prompt. Short side story, I was also done with Windows and tried a bunch of Linux distros at the time. Being a noob and all, I lost my info while dual booting and had to code the hole thing again.

A couple of years past that, I have devoted considerable effort into developing my math and coding skills and although there’s a ton of work pending.

At Ironhack I hope to find the required tools to start working at the medium as well as a solid community.

I wish to direct my development towards the fields of Gamification and machine learning.
