# Who am I?
My name is Zahid SÃ¡nchez, I'm from Mexico City and I'm a full-time student at UNAM. Last semester I took a basic data course and learned about some of the tools that python offers.

# Why am I here?
When I was about to take the data course last semester a friend of mine mentioned Ironhack was a better option, so I looked it up and decided to apply. I'm looking forward to learning more about machine learning.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?
I don't have anything concrete about the job I'm looking for after the bootcamp as long as I use what I learned. My goal for the future to get a job in Silicon Valley.
