# Who am I

* My name is Alejandro
* I'm originally from Oaxaca City but I am currently living on Mexico City. 
* I am a Market Intelligence Analyst at Beat.
* I once developed semiautomatic processes on Google Scripts, but that's about it. Everything I know regarding tech is 
from working at Beat. 

# Why am I here

* I got into the bootcamp because I want to be a better analyst for my company and hopefully, work at the HQ in Amsterdam. 
* I expect to be proficient in SQL and Python.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I will forever be attached to the tech industry, and for now I'd like to keep my eyes on Mobility. 
* The near future holds a Senior Analyst role at the Operations Team at Beat.  
* Become Head of Operations at Beat, then General Manager.
